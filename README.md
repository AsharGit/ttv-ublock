# TTV ad-block

Chrome/Firefox extension that _should?_ block ads on Twitch.

For security, this extension uses the minimum amount of permissions possible, and [the code](https://github.com/odensc/ttv-ublock/blob/extension/background.js) is as simple as possible.

## Chrome installation

1. Download the ZIP file of the extension code: https://github.com/odensc/ttv-ublock/archive/extension.zip
2. Unzip it into a new folder.
3. Open the Extensions page. [**Image example**](https://i.imgur.com/ErYvch2.png)

The extension should install! Enjoy.

## Firefox installation

Unfortunately Firefox doesn't allow for direct installation via the source code from GitHub, so I have to distribute a signed file from Mozilla. The code is unmodified and you can verify it as such.

1. Download the XPI extension file: https://github.com/odensc/ttv-ublock/releases/download/firefox/ttv_ad_block-1.0.0-fx.xpi
1. Open the Add-ons page. [**Image example**](https://i.imgur.com/HLpzdjN.png)
1. Near the top right, click the gear, then "Install Add-on From File..." [**Image example**](https://i.imgur.com/XSWqD1F.png)
1. A file dialog will open. Navigate to the .xpi file you previously downloaded and select it. [**Image example**](https://i.imgur.com/htkjdNf.png)
1. A popup will open. Click Add [**Image example**](https://i.imgur.com/FcdWXHU.png)

The extension should install! You may need to restart your browser. Enjoy.
